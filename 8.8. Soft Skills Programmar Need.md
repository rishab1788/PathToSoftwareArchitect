# Great Architects Should Have Great Soft Skills

- **Chief Information Officer (CIO)** 👔
- **IT Service** 💼
- **Architect** 🏗️ 
  - No direct authority
  - Influence through expertise and collaboration
  - Must avoid arrogance or righteousness
- **Project Manager** 📅
- **Development Manager** 🛠️
- **Developers** 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Listening 👂
- **Value Diverse Perspectives**: Always assume you are not the smartest person in the room. Embrace collective wisdom.
- **Active Listening**: Pay close attention, ask clarifying questions, and ensure you understand others' viewpoints.

## Dealing with Criticism 🗣️
- **Professional Response**: Do not attack back. Address criticism with facts and logic. If unsure, acknowledge the feedback and commit to further review.
- **Handling Mockery**: Stay composed. Don’t get offended or retaliate. Maintain professionalism and provide reasoned responses.

## Be Smart, Not Right 🤔
- **Focus on Solutions**: When faced with disagreements, prioritize finding a workable solution over proving you’re right.
  - **Example**: If someone questions your choice of a stateless pattern:
    - **Response**: "Great point! We’ve considered this thoroughly and believe this approach is optimal. Let’s discuss this further in a one-on-one meeting."

- **Respect and Diplomacy**: Show respect to senior stakeholders, like the CTO. Offer private meetings to address concerns and avoid lengthy technical debates.

## Navigating Organizational Politics 🏛️
- **Build Relationships**: Develop a good rapport with key decision-makers, including those who may influence future decisions.
- **Stay Neutral**: Avoid getting caught up in office politics. Focus on delivering value rather than engaging in political maneuvering.

## Public Speaking 🎤
- **Clear Objectives**: Define the goal of your presentation.
- **Know Your Audience**: Tailor your message to their needs and level of understanding.
- **Confidence**: Present with confidence, avoid reading directly from slides, and maintain eye contact to engage your audience.

## Continuous Learning 📚
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with emerging technologies and industry trends.
- **Resource Utilization**: Read blogs (e.g., DZONE), articles (e.g., InfoQ), and attend conferences (e.g., QCon, //build/) to enhance your knowledge.

## Soft Skills Summary 🤝
- **Collaborative Approach**: As an architect, you work with people. Leverage soft skills to influence and collaborate effectively, even without formal authority.
