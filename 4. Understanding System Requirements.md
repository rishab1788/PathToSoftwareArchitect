# 🛠️ System Requirements

## 🚀 What the System Should Do

### 🔄 Business Flows
- **Example**: Login process.

### 🛡️ Business Services
- **Example**: Login service, Data access service.

### 🎨 User Interfaces
- Look and feel.
- Responsiveness.

## 📋 Functional Requirements
- These are the specific functions and features that the system must support, integral to the business.

## 🏗️ Non-Functional Requirements
- Non-functional requirements describe how the system should handle operational aspects like performance, load, and data volume. These are crucial for the system's success and stability.

### 📈 Key Non-Functional Requirements
- **⚡ Performance**:
  - **Fast**: What is the required performance? Always talk in numbers.
  - **⏱️ Latency**:
    - How much time does it take to perform a single task? (e.g., API call)
    - Example: 1-second latency; well-designed systems can achieve > 1000 requests per second, while poorly designed systems might only manage 60.
  - **🚀 Throughput**:
    - How many tasks can be performed in a given time unit?

- **🧱 Load**:
  - The quantity of work the system can handle without crashing.
  - **Example**: In a web API, how many concurrent requests can it handle?
    - Throughput: > 100 requests/second.
    - Load: Capable of handling 500 requests without crashing.
    - Always plan for extreme cases! 💥

- **💾 Data Volume**:
  - How much data the system will accumulate over time.
  - Helps with:
    - Deciding on the type of databas
