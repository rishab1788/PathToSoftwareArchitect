How to spot a performance problems ? 
-> Every performance problems is the result of some queue building somewhere
    * Network Socket queue, DB IO queue, OS run queue etc.

Resons for queue build-up 
* Inefficient slow processing
* Serial resource access
* Limited resource capcity 

Performance Principles 
* Efficiency 
  - Efficient Resource Utilization
    - IO Memory network Disk
    - CPU
  - Efficient Logic 
    - Algorithms
    - Db queries
  - Efficient Data Storage
    - Data strcuture
    - DB Scehma
  - Caching
* Concurrency 
  - Hardware
  - Software 
    - Queuing 
    - Coherence
* Capcity
