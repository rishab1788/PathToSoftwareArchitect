# Concurrency Control in Multithreaded Environments

Concurrency control is crucial for ensuring that data integrity is maintained when multiple threads are working simultaneously. Below are some key mechanisms and their characteristics:

## Pessimistic Locking 🛑🔒

- **Steps Involved**:
  1. **Fetch & Lock Records**: Records are locked before being fetched to prevent other threads from accessing them.
  2. **Process Records**: Operations are performed on the locked records.
  3. **Update Records**: Changes are made to the records.
  4. **Commit**: The transaction is committed, releasing the lock.

- **Characteristics**:
  - The **process is locked** 🔒, making the duration of the locking process shorter.
  - **Threads must wait** to acquire a lock, leading to potential delays.
  - Best used when **contention is high** 🔥.
  - May result in **deadlocks** ⚠️ when two or more threads are stuck waiting for each other to release locks.
  - **Used when a collision is anticipated**. If a transaction might violate synchronization, it’s simply blocked.

## Optimistic Locking 🚦

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Threads do not wait for a lock** but proceed with the assumption that there won’t be any conflict.
  - Threads back out and retry if they discover a contention 🛑.
  - Best used when contention is **low to moderate** 🎯.
  - May result in **starvation** when threads constantly fail to acquire a lock, in which case you might switch to pessimistic locking.
  - **Good for performance** 🚀, especially in scenarios with low contention.
  - Can be utilized in **business optimization** cases where minimal conflict is expected.

## Compare & Swap (CAS) 🔁

- **Overview**:
  - CAS is an **optimistic locking mechanism** that relies on the atomicity of CPU instructions.
  - Supported by all modern hardware CPUs 🖥️.
  - Java implements CAS through the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.*` classes.

- **Example in Java**:
  ```java
  AtomicInteger ai = new AtomicInteger(10);
  ai.compareAndSet(10, 20);
  // Returns true if the current value was 10 and updates it to 20.
  // Returns false if the value was not 10 due to a race condition.
  ```
  
- CAS is a foundation for **optimistic locking** in **NoSQL databases** 🚀.

## Deadlocks 🔗❌

- **What is it?**:
  - Deadlocks occur when **threads try to acquire multiple locks** simultaneously and end up blocking each other.
  
- **Example**:
  - Simultaneous money transfers between accounts X and Y using Thread T1 and T2:
    - T1 transfers from X to Y.
    - T2 transfers from Y to X.
    - **Solution**: Acquire locks in a **fixed global order** to avoid deadlocks.

- **Request Load-Related Deadlocks**:
  - Occur when a thread is waiting for connections to multiple databases 🗄️.
  - Running out of connections can cause deadlocks.
  - Threads may also deadlock when waiting for a gateway service under high load 🔄.

## Coherence Delays ⏳

- **Visibility (Volatile)**:
  - In Java, a `volatile` object is always read from and written back to **main memory**.
  - This ensures visibility across threads 🧵 but may result in performance overhead.

- **Locking (Synchronized)**:
  - Locks (using `synchronized`) ensure that a block of code is accessed by only one thread at a time.

- **Memory Barriers**:
  - Memory barriers are used to enforce ordering and visibility of memory operations, which may cause invalidation or flushing of caches 🔄, leading to delays.
