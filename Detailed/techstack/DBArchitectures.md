Q. What is Apache Cassandra?

- Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed and decentralized/distributed storage system (database), 
for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across the world. 
It provides highly available service with no single point of failure


It is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent.
It is a column-oriented database.
Its distribution design is based on Amazon’s Dynamo and its data model on Google’s Big Table.
Created at Facebook, it differs sharply from relational database management systems.
Cassandra implements a Dynamo-style replication model with no single point of failure but adds a more powerful “column family” data model.
Cassandra is being used by some of the biggest companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, Rackspace, ebay, Twitter, Netflix, and more.
