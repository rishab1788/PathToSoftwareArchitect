# Amazon RDS Overview 🚀

**RDS** stands for **Relational Database Service**.  
It is a managed database service for relational databases that use SQL as a query language.  
RDS allows you to create databases in the cloud, managed by AWS.  

## Supported Databases 📋
- PostgreSQL  
- MySQL  
- MariaDB  
- Oracle  
- SQL Server  
- Aurora (AWS proprietary database)

## Advantages of Using RDS vs Deploying a Database on EC2 💡
RDS is a **managed service**, offering the following benefits:  
- 🚀 **Automated provisioning** and **OS patching**.  
- 🔄 Continuous backups and the ability to restore to specific timestamps.  
- 📊 Monitoring dashboards.  
- 📖 **Read replicas** for improved read performance.  
- 🔄 Multi-AZ setup for disaster recovery (DR).  
- 🔧 Maintenance windows for upgrades.  
- 📈 Scalability options.  
- 💾 Storage backed by **EBS**.  

**Limitations:**  
- You cannot SSH into the database instances.

## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling 📈
RDS helps dynamically increase storage on your database instance when needed.  

### How it Works:
- Automatically modifies storage if:  
  - Free storage is less than **10%** of allocated storage.  
  - Low storage persists for at least **5 minutes**.  
  - At least **6 hours** have passed since the last modification.  

### Benefits:
- Ideal for applications with **unpredictable workloads**.  
- Supported by all RDS database engines.  

### Data Flow:  
`User → Application (Read/Write) → Amazon RDS → Storage`

## RDS Read Replicas for Read Scalability 📚
**Read replicas** improve performance by offloading read requests.  

- **Replication:** Asynchronous, so reads are eventually consistent.  
- **Capacity:** Up to **15 read replicas** within an AZ, across AZs, or across regions.  
- **Promotion:** Read replicas can be promoted to act as standalone databases.  

### Use Cases:
- Production database handling normal workloads.  
- Offload analytics or reporting to a **read replica** without affecting the production application.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Not suitable for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.  
  - Designed for **read-only** operations like `SELECT`.

### Network Cost:
- No fee for read replicas within the **same region**.  
- **Cross-region read replicas** incur network transfer costs.

## RDS Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery 🛡️
Multi-AZ provides high availability and disaster recovery by using **synchronous replication**.  

- **Single DNS Name:** Automatic failover to a standby instance.  
- **Increased Availability:** Handles failovers in case of:  
  - AZ failure.  
  - Network loss.  
  - System maintenance.  

### Key Features:
- No manual intervention required for applications during failover.  
- **Note:** Read replicas can also be set up alongside Multi-AZ for additional scalability.
