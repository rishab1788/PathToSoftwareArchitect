# Amazon RDS Overview 🚀

**RDS** stands for **Relational Database Service**.  
It is a managed database service for relational databases that use SQL as a query language.  
RDS allows you to create databases in the cloud, managed by AWS.  

## Supported Databases 📋
- PostgreSQL  
- MySQL  
- MariaDB  
- Oracle  
- SQL Server  
- Aurora (AWS proprietary database)

## Advantages of Using RDS vs Deploying a Database on EC2 💡
RDS is a **managed service**, offering the following benefits:  
- 🚀 **Automated provisioning** and **OS patching**.  
- 🔄 Continuous backups and the ability to restore to specific timestamps.  
- 📊 Monitoring dashboards.  
- 📖 **Read replicas** for improved read performance.  
- 🔄 Multi-AZ setup for disaster recovery (DR).  
- 🔧 Maintenance windows for upgrades.  
- 📈 Scalability options.  
- 💾 Storage backed by **EBS**.  

**Limitations:**  
- You cannot SSH into the database instances.

## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling 📈
RDS helps dynamically increase storage on your database instance when needed.  

### How it Works:
- Automatically modifies storage if:  
  - Free storage is less than **10%** of allocated storage.  
  - Low storage persists for at least **5 minutes**.  
  - At least **6 hours** have passed since the last modification.  

### Benefits:
- Ideal for applications with **unpredictable workloads**.  
- Supported by all RDS database engines.  

### Data Flow:  
`User → Application (Read/Write) → Amazon RDS → Storage`

## RDS Read Replicas for Read Scalability 📚
**Read replicas** improve performance by offloading read requests.  

- **Replication:** Asynchronous, so reads are eventually consistent.  
- **Capacity:** Up to **15 read replicas** within an AZ, across AZs, or across regions.  
- **Promotion:** Read replicas can be promoted to act as standalone databases.  

### Use Cases:
- Production database handling normal workloads.  
- Offload analytics or reporting to a **read replica** without affecting the production application.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Not suitable for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.  
  - Designed for **read-only** operations like `SELECT`.

### Network Cost:
- No fee for read replicas within the **same region**.  
- **Cross-region read replicas** incur network transfer costs.  

---

## RDS Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery 🛡️
Multi-AZ provides high availability and disaster recovery by using **synchronous replication**.  

- **Single DNS Name:** Automatic failover to a standby instance.  
- **Increased Availability:** Handles failovers in case of:  
  - AZ failure.  
  - Network loss.  
  - System maintenance.  

### Key Features:
- No manual intervention required for applications during failover.  
- **Note:** Read replicas can also be set up alongside Multi-AZ for additional scalability.

🌟 With RDS, AWS simplifies database management, ensuring scalability, high availability, and disaster recovery while minimizing operational overhead. 🎯



### 

Amazon Aurora 
* aurora is a proprietary techonology from AWS (Not open sourced)
* Postgres and myql both suppoerted as Aurora AB (that mean your drivers will work as if aurora was a postgres or mysql db. )
* aurora is "aws cloud optimized" and claims 5x performances improvement over mySQL on RDS over 3x 
* aurora can have up to 15 replicase and the replication process is faster than mysq; (sub 10ms replica lag)
* failover is aurotoa is instaneous, its HA native.
* Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient.


Aurora High availblity and Read scaling 
* 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
*  * 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
   * 3 copies out of 6 need for reads.
   * self healing with peer-to-peer replications
   * storage is striped across 100s of volumes.
M(Write)  automated failover for master is less than 30 seconds.
Master + up to 15 aurora Read Replicas serve reads.
support for cross-region replications

Aurora DB cluster 

Shared storage  - 
Writer Endpoints
  (Pointing to the master)
M 1 <R R R R R auto scaling>
Reader Endpoint and writer endpoint
Shared storage column Auto expanding from 10 G to 128 TB

Feature of aurors - 
Automatic fail-over 
backup and recovery isolation and security 
Industry compliance
Push-button scaling 
Automated patching with zero downtime
Advanced moniteering 
Routine Maintance 
Backtrack restore data at any point of time without using backups.


aurora hands on DB -

Advance of concept aurora -
replica autoscaling  -

Read CPU usage it will add read replication 
Reader and endpoint is extended.

Aurora Custom Endpoints - 
[Writer Endpoint ]  Reader Ednpoint for bigger run analytical queries on specific repliacas.
THe reader endpoint is generally not used after defining custom endpoints.



Aurora serverless -
Automated databse instation and auto scaling based on actual usage.
Good for infrequent intermitteten or unpredictable workload.
No capacity 
Global Aurora
Aurora cross Region Read Replicase 
  * use ful for disater recovery
  * simplpe to put in place.
  * Auror Global Databa (Recommeced)


RDS backups -
we have automatic backup Daily full backup of the databases (during the backup windows)
  1 to 35 days of retention 

Manual DB snapshots 
  Manually triggered by the user 
  retention of back for as long as you want.



Trick: in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for staoge


Aurora Dabase CLoning 
Creat a new aurora DB cluster ffrom an existing one Faster than Snapshot & restore
uses copy-onwrite protocol


Amazon RDS proxy - 
Fully manages Database proxy for RDS.
Allow apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database.
Improviing database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources eg(CPU, RAM)
Serverless, autoscaling high aviblioe 
Reduced RDS & auror failover by up 66%.
Support RS (Mysql, postgreSql, MariaDb) , auror (Mysql, postgres)
No code  changes required for most apps.
RDS proxy is never publicly accessible.


ElastiCache Overview - 
The same way RDS is to get manges relational DB.
mangfed REdis or memcaches.
chaches are in-memory datbase with really high performance, low latency.
helps make your application statless.
Using elasticache involved heavy application code changes.

write to cache.

Cache must have an invalidation stertegy to make 

Amazon Elastic cache - 

DNS - Domain Name System 
which translate the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresss.
