# Amazon EBS and EFS Overview

## **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

### **What is EBS?**
- A **network drive** you can attach to your EC2 instances while they run.
- **Persists data** even after instance termination.
- Can only be mounted to **one instance at a time**.
- Bound to a specific **availability zone (AZ)**.
- **Network drive** (not a physical drive) that can be detached and moved via snapshots.

### **Key Features**
- **Provisioned Capacity**: 
  - Size in GiBs and IOPS.
- Locked to an AZ but can be replicated using snapshots.
- Examples:
  - `[ US-EAST-1A ]`

### **EBS Snapshots**
- Serve as **backups** for EBS volumes.
- Can be copied to different availability zones.
- **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)**: Forces full initialization of a snapshot for quicker restores.

### **Volume Types**
1. **GP2/GP3 (SSD)**:
   - GP3: Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s.
   - GP2: Small volumes can burst IOPS to 3000.
2. **io1/io2 (SSD)**: High-performance SSD.
3. **st1 (HDD)**: Low-cost HDD.
4. **sc1 (HDD)**: Lowest cost for infrequent access.

### **Multi-Attach**
- **io2 Family** supports attaching the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ.

### **EBS Encryption**
- **Encrypted EBS Volume** provides:
  - Data at rest encryption inside the volume.
  - Encrypted data in transit between the instance and volume.
  - Encrypted snapshots.

## **Amazon Machine Images (AMI)**

### **Overview**
- **AMI** is a customization of an EC2 instance.
- Includes your own software configuration and OS.
- Built for a specific region.

### **Types of AMIs**
1. **Public AMI**: Provided by AWS.
2. **Your Own AMI**: Custom-built and maintained.
3. **Marketplace AMI**: Third-party AMI (can be purchased).

### **AMI Process**
- Create an AMI from an EC2 instance.
- Use the AMI to launch new instances.

## **EC2 Instance Store**

### **What is EC2 Instance Store?**
- High-performance hardware disks attached to an EC2 instance.
- **Data is lost if the instance stops**.
- Ideal for:
  - Buffers, caches, scratch data, or temporary content.
- **Risk**: Data loss if hardware fails.

### **Comparison with EBS**
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but limited performance.
- EC2 Instance Store provides better IOPS performance but lacks persistence.

## **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

### **Overview**
- Managed **Network File System (NFS)** for EC2 instances.
- **Multi-AZ support**.
- Highly available, scalable, and **expensive (3x GP2)**.
- Pay-per-use model.

### **Features**
- **No pre-defined storage** required.
- Scales automatically to petabyte levels.
- Can be mounted on many EC2 instances.
