# DNS Terminology

## Domain Registrar
- Examples: Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy

## DNS Records
- **A**: Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address
- **AAAA**: Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address
- **CNAME**: Maps a hostname to another hostname
- **NS**: Name Server records

## Zone File
- Contains DNS records for a domain

## Name Server
- Resolves DNS queries
- Can be **Authoritative** or **Non-Authoritative**

## Top-Level Domain (TLD)
- Examples: .com, .us, .in, .gov

## Second-Level Domain (SLD)
- Examples: amazon.com, google.com

# How DNS Works

1. **Web Browser** sends a request
2. **Local DNS Server** processes the request
3. **Root DNS Server** (Managed by ICANN) routes the request
4. **TLD DNS Server** (Managed by IANA) routes further
5. **SLD DNS Server** (Managed by Domain Registrar) resolves the domain to an IP address
6. The **Web Server** (e.g., 9.101.11.12) responds

# Amazon Route 53
- Highly available, scalable, fully managed, and authoritative DNS
- **Authoritative**: Customers can update DNS records
- **Domain Registrar**: Also provides domain registration
- The only AWS service with a **100% availability SLA**

## Why Use Route 53?
- Define how traffic should be routed for a domain
- Each record contains:
  - **Domain/Subdomain Name** (e.g., example.com)
  - **Record Type** (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.)
  - **Value** (e.g., 12.12.2.2)
  - **Routing Policy** (Determines how Route 53 responds to queries)
  - **TTL** (Time-to-Live: how long records are cached by DNS resolvers)

## Supported DNS Record Types
- **A**: Maps a hostname to IPv4
- **AAAA**: Maps a hostname to IPv6
- **CNAME**: Maps a hostname to another hostname
  - Target must have an A or AAAA record
  - **Cannot create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)**
  - Example: You **cannot** create a CNAME for `example.com`, but you **can** create one for `www.example.com`

# Route 53 Hosted Zones
- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains

## Public Hosted Zones
- Contain records specifying how to route traffic for a domain

## Registering a Domain
- Amazon Route 53 allows users to register domains and manage DNS settings

# CNAME vs ALIAS

## **CNAME**
- Points a hostname to **any other hostname**
- Example: `app.mydomain.com -> blabla.anything.com`
- Only applicable for **non-root domains** (e.g., `something.mydomain.com`)

## **ALIAS**
- Points a hostname to an **AWS resource** (e.g., Load Balancer, CloudFront, etc.)
- Example: `app.mydomain.com -> AWS service`
- **Free of charge** and supports AWS health checks
