   - **Examples:**
     - "I wanted to have a conversation with you about X."
     - "I noticed we haven't talked much lately. You mentioned [specific detail]."
     - "Hey, you told me you'd take care of this by Monday. It's important to me that we follow through for each other. Can we discuss how to make that happen together?"
