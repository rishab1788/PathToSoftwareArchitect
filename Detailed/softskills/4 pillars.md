Have you discovered any of your colleagues do something inappropriate?
Have you ever had a colleague who
• Makes quick judgment on others and formalizes their
judgment with destructive comments
• Tends to focus on helping anyone even when help is not
welcome
• Is not willing to accept any help under any circumstances
• Keeps bragging about his or her accomplishments
whenever an opportunity arises
• Spreads negative emotions at the workplace, such as
anger or lack of motivation, affecting the mood of other
people
• Fails to give you any feedback at any time and even fails to
say thank you
• Keeps waiting for their own turn in the conversation, or
keeps interrupting you, refusing to listen to you
• Is friendly with you, but trash-talks you when you are not
present
• Gets offended for no reason and blames you for how
they feel about a random topic
• Gets and keeps all the credit for your accomplishments?
