Perfectionism is another consequence of fear. Make sure that your high-quality
work comes from sticking to your standards and not from the fear of not
being perfect. No one is perfect, and perfectionism eventually leads to loss of
motivation. Loss of motivation results in procrastination.


 As a result, you will need to rely on less tactics; and you will develop the
necessary problem-solving skills and judgment to approach situations where
simple solutions don’t exist

Discover Your Individual Goals

The goal of this chapter is to understand your current situation, understand
where you want to be, and construct a plan to make your way to the desired
destination.


If you could take away just one thing from this book, always focus on increasing
your career capital. 


Carl Newport argued that you will
become happy and passionate in your job as you gain valuable experience.
According to studies he based his research on, job satisfaction has very little
to do with passion you feel toward your job before you start working.


Discover how generalists become specialists and T-shaped
professionals.
• Compare the tech expert, the domain expert, the process
expert, and expertise in leadership and management.
• Intrapreneurship in startups and corporations.
• Consider career capital in shaping your career.


A generalist can solve many simple problems, without diving deeply into a
certain domain. Imagine a generalist as a horizontal profile of knowing a lot of
things on a basic level.
A specialist lacks the knowledge of a generalist, but has unmatched knowledge
in their area of specialization. In other words, a specialist may be able to write
client-side rich web applications using JavaScript, React, and Redux. They
know the ins and outs of the frameworks and can write efficient solutions.
However, when it comes to server administration, writing efficient CSS, or
even setting up a developer environment, a specialist may crash and burn
without the help of a generalis


There is high demand for T-shaped professionals, having both a horizontal
generalist profile and a vertical specialist profile in one field. T-shaped
professionals can work on their level of expertise without needing many
people to support them. Being a T-shaped professional is an act of taking full
responsibility for your actions, and this is why I suggest that you become a
T-shaped professional too if you are targeting an expert role.


In some occasions, good experts earn more than their leads. An excellent
expert almost always earns more than a demotivated manager who wanted
to become an expert but was tricked into believing that becoming a manager
meant more money.


Domain Experts
A domain expert is genuinely interested in how their industry works. The
added value of the domain expert lies in knowing the ins and outs of the
product or service a company is offering, including ideas about how to make
things better.
