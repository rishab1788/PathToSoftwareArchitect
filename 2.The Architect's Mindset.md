# 🏛️ Architect Mindset

### 1. **Point of View**  
   - Adapt new perspectives and continually build assets. An architect must be flexible and open to different viewpoints to create valuable solutions.

# 💼 Understanding the Business

### 1. **It May Sound Trivial, But It’s Essential**
   - Understanding the business is crucial for an architect. You might think it's obvious, but deep business knowledge sets the foundation for effective architecture.

### 2. **Examples of Business Understanding**
   - **Microsoft, Amazon**: These tech giants thrive because their architects understand their business goals intimately.
   - **IoT Fields**: Imagine working with a company of 600 employees. You must understand what they do, their revenue streams, and their profitability to align your architecture with their needs.

### 3. **Familiarize Yourself With Key Business Elements**
   - **Weaknesses**: Know where the business is vulnerable.
   - **Strengths**: Leverage the company's strengths in your designs.
   - **Competition**: Understand the competitive landscape to future-proof your architecture.
   - **Growth Strategy**: Align your architecture with the company’s long-term growth plans.

### 4. **Architects Must Understand the Business as a Living Organism**
   - The business is dynamic and evolving. As an architect, your solutions must be adaptable and grow with the business.

# 🎯 The System’s Goals

### 1. **Not Just About "What the System Should Do"**
   - Focus on the broader goals, not just the system's functionality.

### 2. **Goals Describe the Effect on the Organization**
   - Understand how the system impacts the organization as a whole.

### 3. **Usually Described by the Client**
   - Clients often set the goals, but there are exceptions where you might need to help define them.

# 👥 Work for Your Client’s Clients

### 1. **The Chain of Influence**
   - **(You are here) → IT → End Users (Client’s Clients)**  
     - Always keep in mind that your work ultimately affects the end users, even if you’re working through layers of abstraction.

### 2. **System Analyst’s Job**
   - You still need to understand your client's environment to be effective.

### 3. **Client’s Perspective**
   - Your client might not see the end users as their clients, but you should. Your architecture should aim to serve the end user’s needs indirectly.

### 4. **Try to Influence Others**
   - Convert others to see the importance of considering the end users in their decisions.

# 🗣️ Watch Your Language

### 1. **Tailor Your Communication**
   - Always consider what really matters to the person you're talking to.

### 2. **Examples:**
   - **Dave, The Team Leader**:  
     Cares about programming.  
     _“Have you heard about the latest Angular version? We’re going to use it!”_
   - **Shelly, The CEO**:  
     Focuses on business continuity, not technical jargon.  
     _“The architecture I've designed will ensure the continuity of the business and handle peak times effectively.”_

### 3. **Proposing an Architecture to a Project Manager**
   - Consider the project manager's priorities and craft your message accordingly. Emphasize reliability, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with project goals.
