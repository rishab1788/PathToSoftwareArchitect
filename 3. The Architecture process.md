# 🛠️ Steps to Designing a System Architecture

## 1. 🎯 Understand the System's Requirements
- Start by setting clear goals.
- **Requirements** = What the system should do.
- Typically designed by the system analyst.

## 2. 📋 Understand the Non-Functional Requirements
- Define technical and service-level attributes.
- Examples include the number of users, load volumes, performance, etc.
- These requirements may not always be known to the client or analyst.

## 3. 🗺️ Map the Components
- Represent the tasks of the system.
- **Two goals:**
  - Understand the system's functionality.
  - Communicate your understanding effectively.

## 4. 🧰 Select the Technology Stack
- Decide on the platform, covering backend, frontend, and data storage.
- Choose wisely—many factors come into play! ⚖️

## 5. 🏗️ Design the Architecture
- Describe the process and the overall architecture.
- Ensure it aligns with both functional and non-functional requirements.

## 6. 📄 Write the Architecture Document
- The document must be relevant to all participants.
- It should serve as a clear guide for developers, analysts, and stakeholders.

## 7. 🤝 Support the Team
- The architecture will evolve over time.
- Dilemmas will arise; ensure the architecture remains relevant and adaptable.

## 8. 🌟 Extra
- **Learn about unknown scenarios early**: This helps in designing a more resilient system.
- **Grow ambassadors within the team**: Encourage team members to advocate for the architecture and its principles.
