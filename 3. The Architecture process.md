# Steps to Designing a System Architecture

## 1. Understand the System's Requirements
- Begin by setting the goals.
- **Requirements** = What the system should do.
- Usually designed by the system analyst.

## 2. Understand the Non-Functional Requirements
- Define technical and service-level attributes.
- Examples include the number of users, load volumes, performance, etc.
- These requirements may not always be known to the client or analyst.

## 3. Map the Components
- Represent the tasks of the system.
- **Two goals:**
  - Understand the system's functionality.
  - Communicate your understanding.

## 4. Select the Technology Stack
- Decide on the platform, typically covering backend, frontend, and data storage.
- Choose wiselyâ€”many factors come into play!

## 5. Design the Architecture
- Describe the process and the architecture.
- Ensure it aligns with both functional and non-functional requirements.

## 6. Write the Architecture Document
- The document must be relevant to all participants.
- It should serve as a clear guide for developers, analysts, and stakeholders.

## 7. Support the Team
- The architecture will evolve over time.
- Dilemmas will arise; ensure the architecture remains relevant and adaptable.


## 8. Extra
- Learn about unknown scenarios early.
- Grow ambassadors within the team to advocate for the architecture.
